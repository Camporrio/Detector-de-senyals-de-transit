# Detector-de-senyals-de-transit

The purpose of this project consists on the implementation of a recognising tool of traffic
signals in real time, making use of computer vision. The system can recognise different traffic signals
grouped in three categories based on the existing ones defined by the ’Dirección General de Tráfico’
(DGT). Those categories are the blue orientation signals,white orientation signals, and general
indication signals. Once detected and classified, those signals will be showed to the user depending
on the type and order where the system recognise them.

- signal_detector.py is the main file

- colorange_detector.py is a support file to detect color range of an image

- gui_signalsdetector.py is the UI
